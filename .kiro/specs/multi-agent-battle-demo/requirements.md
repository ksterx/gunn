# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a 2D multi-agent battle simulation demo that showcases the capabilities of the Gunn multi-agent simulation core. The demo features two teams of 3 CPU agents each, engaging in real-time combat while demonstrating Gunn's orchestration, observation policies, and agent coordination capabilities. The system uses OpenAI's structured outputs for AI decision-making, FastAPI for the backend, and Pygame for the frontend visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating Gunn, I want to see a complete multi-agent simulation demo, so that I can understand how to integrate Gunn into my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the demo is launched THEN the system SHALL initialize two teams of 3 agents each automatically
2. WHEN the simulation starts THEN agents SHALL begin making decisions using OpenAI structured outputs
3. WHEN the demo runs THEN it SHALL showcase Gunn's core capabilities including orchestration, observation policies, and event logging
4. WHEN the simulation completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the winner and key events

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Gunn library user, I want to see real-time multi-agent coordination, so that I can understand how agents can work together in teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are on the same team THEN they SHALL be able to communicate with each other through in-team chat
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN their messages SHALL only be visible to team members
3. WHEN agents make decisions THEN they SHALL consider team coordination and strategy
4. WHEN multiple agents act simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent actions properly
5. WHEN agents coordinate THEN they SHALL demonstrate tactical behaviors like covering teammates or coordinated attacks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a simulation observer, I want to see diverse agent behaviors and interactions, so that I can evaluate the richness of the multi-agent system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents take actions THEN they SHALL be able to move, attack, repair weapons, heal, and communicate
2. WHEN agents need weapon repair THEN they SHALL only be able to repair at designated forge locations
3. WHEN agents communicate and act THEN they SHALL be able to perform both simultaneously
4. WHEN agents make decisions THEN they SHALL use structured schemas to ensure valid actions
5. WHEN agents interact with the environment THEN they SHALL demonstrate intelligent behavior patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean separation between frontend and backend, so that I can understand how to integrate Gunn with different interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is architected THEN the backend SHALL use FastAPI to expose Gunn functionality
2. WHEN the frontend needs data THEN it SHALL communicate with the backend through REST APIs
3. WHEN the frontend displays the simulation THEN it SHALL use Pygame for 2D visualization
4. WHEN the frontend makes requests THEN it SHALL NOT directly call OpenAI APIs
5. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN demo-specific packages SHALL be isolated using uv groups

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Gunn maintainer, I want the demo to identify library gaps, so that I can improve the core framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the demo THEN any missing Gunn functionality SHALL be identified and implemented
2. WHEN extending Gunn THEN new features SHALL be generic and not game-specific
3. WHEN Gunn limitations are found THEN they SHALL be documented as feedback for library improvement
4. WHEN new Gunn features are added THEN they SHALL follow proper spec-driven development
5. WHEN the demo is complete THEN it SHALL serve as a reference implementation for other Gunn users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a simulation participant, I want to see engaging combat mechanics, so that the demo is interesting and demonstrates complex interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents engage in combat THEN they SHALL have health points that decrease when attacked
2. WHEN agents' weapons degrade THEN they SHALL need to visit forges for repairs
3. WHEN agents are injured THEN they SHALL be able to heal themselves or teammates
4. WHEN agents die THEN they SHALL be removed from the simulation
5. WHEN one team eliminates the other THEN the simulation SHALL end with a clear winner

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a technical evaluator, I want to see proper error handling and robustness, so that I can assess the system's reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenAI API calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
2. WHEN invalid actions are attempted THEN they SHALL be rejected with clear feedback
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the frontend SHALL continue to function with cached data
4. WHEN the simulation encounters errors THEN they SHALL be logged appropriately
5. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN the simulation SHALL continue smoothly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to see the system handle concurrent operations efficiently, so that I can evaluate Gunn's scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents act simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process actions concurrently
2. WHEN the simulation runs THEN it SHALL maintain smooth frame rates in the frontend
3. WHEN agents make decisions THEN response times SHALL be reasonable for real-time gameplay
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL maintain deterministic behavior
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN performance metrics SHALL be available through Gunn's telemetry
