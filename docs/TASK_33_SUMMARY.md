## Requirements Demonstrated

The demo comprehensively demonstrates **ALL** critical specifications:

### ✅ Asynchronous Agent Execution (Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.6)

- Immediate re-observation after actions
- Reactive responses to other agents
- Natural conversations with interruptions
- Spatial awareness and reactions
- Collaborative opportunity detection

### ✅ Asynchronous Agent Loop Pattern (Requirements 14.1-14.9)
- Observe-think-act loop implementation
- Context building from observations
- LLM-driven decision making
- Personality-based behavior
- Graceful error handling

### ✅ Observation Delivery Guarantees (Requirements 15.1-15.6)
- At-least-once delivery
- Delivery tracking with IDs
- Redelivery on timeout
- Idempotent handling
- Exponential backoff

### ✅ Action Completion Confirmation (Requirements 16.1-16.5)
- Completion tracking
- EffectApplied events
- Wait for completion
- Timeout handling
- Request ID tracking

### ✅ Intelligent Staleness Detection (Requirements 17.1-17.6)
- Intent-specific staleness logic
- Spatial awareness in staleness checks
- Conversation context validation
- False positive prevention
- Configurable policies

### ✅ Priority Fairness and Quota Management (Requirements 18.1-18.5)

- Hash chain integrity
- Replay capability
- Consistency validation
- Recovery options

## Configuration Notes

### Staleness Threshold

The demo uses a `staleness_threshold=100` which is higher than typical fast-paced simulations. This is intentional because:

1. **Conversational Context**: Conversations don't change as rapidly as spatial positions
2. **Agent Response Times**: With variable response times (0.10s to 0.25s), agents may process observations at different speeds
3. **Natural Flow**: Higher threshold allows more natural conversation flow without excessive staleness rejections
4. **Educational Purpose**: Demonstrates that staleness threshold should be tuned based on application needs

For fast-paced spatial simulations or real-time games, a lower threshold (5-10) would be more appropriate.
