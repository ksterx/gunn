# Comprehensive Asynchronous Multi-Agent Demo

## Overview

The comprehensive asynchronous multi-agent demo (`examples/async_multi_agent_demo.py`) is the flagship demonstration of the Gunn multi-agent simulation system. It showcases **all critical specifications** in a single, cohesive demonstration that illustrates how agents can operate independently, collaborate naturally, and maintain system guarantees.

## What This Demo Demonstrates

### Core Asynchronous Execution (Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.6)

- **Independent Agent Operation**: Each agent operates at its own pace without waiting for others
- **Variable Response Times**: Agents have different LLM response times (0.10s to 0.25s base delay)
- **No Synchronization Barriers**: Agents don't wait for turns or synchronization points
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple agents process observations and generate intents simultaneously

### Continuous Observation and Reactive Behavior (Requirements 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.6)

- **Immediate Re-observation**: Agents observe the world state after every action
- **Reactive Responses**: Agents respond to changes from other agents in real-time
- **Natural Conversations**: Agents engage in multi-turn conversations with interruptions
- **Spatial Awareness**: Agents observe and react to nearby agents' positions and movements
- **Collaborative Opportunities**: Agents detect and respond to collaboration opportunities

### Asynchronous Agent Loop Pattern (Requirements 14.1-14.9)

- **Observe-Think-Act Loop**: Each agent follows a continuous observe-think-act cycle
- **Context Building**: Agents build context from observations including nearby agents and recent messages
- **LLM-Driven Decisions**: Agents use LLM clients to generate intents based on observations
- **Personality-Based Behavior**: Each agent has a distinct personality affecting their decisions
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Agents handle errors and continue operating

### Observation Delivery Guarantees (Requirements 15.1-15.6)

- **At-Least-Once Delivery**: Observations are delivered at least once to each agent
- **Delivery Tracking**: System tracks delivery IDs and acknowledgments
- **Redelivery on Timeout**: Unacknowledged observations are redelivered
- **Idempotent Handling**: Agents handle duplicate observations gracefully
- **Exponential Backoff**: Redelivery uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming agents

### Action Completion Confirmation (Requirements 16.1-16.5)

- **Completion Tracking**: System tracks when intents are converted to effects and applied
- **EffectApplied Events**: Automatic emission of completion events when effects are applied
- **Wait for Completion**: Agents can wait for their actions to be confirmed before proceeding
- **Timeout Handling**: Completion waits have configurable timeouts
- **Request ID Tracking**: Each intent has a unique request ID for tracking

### Intelligent Staleness Detection (Requirements 17.1-17.6)

- **Intent-Specific Logic**: Different staleness rules for different intent types
- **Spatial Awareness**: Move intents check if relevant spatial preconditions changed
- **Conversation Context**: Speak intents check if conversation context is still valid
- **False Positive Prevention**: Only triggers on relevant precondition changes
- **Configurable Policies**: Staleness policies can be customized per intent type

### Priority Fairness and Quota Management (Requirements 18.1-18.5)

- **Token Bucket Rate Limiting**: Per-agent rate limiting using token bucket algorithm
- **Priority Aging**: Wait time increases priority to prevent starvation
- **Weighted Round-Robin**: Fair scheduling with aging-adjusted priorities
- **Configurable Quotas**: Quota policies can be customized per agent
- **Backpressure Responses**: Configurable responses when quotas are exceeded

### Temporal Authority and Action Duration (Requirements 19.1-19.5)

- **Duration Support**: Effects can have duration_ms for interval effects
- **Apply-At Timestamps**: Effects can be scheduled for future application
- **Temporal Authority**: Configurable priority (external > sim_time > wall_time)
- **Smooth Interpolation**: Move actions support start/end timestamps
- **Conflict Resolution**: Overlapping duration-based effects are resolved

### Storage Consistency and Replay Invariance (Requirements 20.1-20.5)

- **Deterministic Ordering**: Events are ordered deterministically for replay
- **Hash Chain Integrity**: Event log maintains hash chain for integrity verification
- **Replay Capability**: Simulations can be replayed from event logs
- **Consistency Validation**: System validates replay produces identical results
- **Recovery Options**: Detailed diagnostics for consistency violations
