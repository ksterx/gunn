# Gunn Multi-Agent Simulation Core - Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples and demonstrations of the gunn multi-agent simulation core capabilities. These examples serve as both tutorials and integration tests, showing how to use the system in various scenarios.

## Quick Start

Run all demos with a single command:

```bash
# Run all demos
python examples/run_all_demos.py

# Run in quick mode (faster execution)
python examples/run_all_demos.py --quick

# Run a specific demo
python examples/run_all_demos.py --demo abc
```

## Available Examples

### 1. A/B/C Conversation Demo (`abc_conversation_demo.py`)

**Features Demonstrated:**
- Multi-agent conversation with partial observation
- Intelligent interruption based on context staleness
- Visible regeneration when context changes
- Cancel token integration with 100ms SLO
- Deterministic event ordering and replay capability

**Key Requirements Addressed:**
- 4.1: Issue cancel_token with current context_digest

**Usage:**
```bash
python examples/abc_conversation_demo.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're running from project root
   cd /path/to/gunn
   python examples/abc_conversation_demo.py
   ```

2. **Performance Issues**
   ```bash
   # Run in quick mode for faster execution
   python examples/run_all_demos.py --quick

   # Run individual demos
   python examples/run_all_demos.py --demo abc
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**
   ```bash
   # Monitor system resources
   # Reduce agent counts in demos if needed
   # Use quick mode to reduce load
   ```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable debug logging for detailed output
python examples/run_all_demos.py --log-level DEBUG

# Check specific demo with debug logging
python examples/abc_conversation_demo.py --log-level DEBUG
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These examples can be used as integration tests:

```bash
# In CI pipeline
python examples/run_all_demos.py --quick
exit_code=$?

if [ $exit_code -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "All demos passed"
else
    echo "Some demos failed"
    exit $exit_code
fi
```

## Contributing

When adding new examples:

1. Follow the existing pattern with comprehensive docstrings
2. Include requirements addressed in comments
3. Add error handling and cleanup
4. Update this README with the new example
5. Add the example to `run_all_demos.py`

## Next Steps

After running these examples:

1. Read the complete tutorial in `tutorial.md`
2. Explore the source code to understand implementation details
3. Try modifying the examples to experiment with different scenarios
4. Use the examples as templates for your own applications
5. Contribute improvements or additional examples

These examples demonstrate that the gunn multi-agent simulation core successfully implements all the requirements from the specification and provides a robust, performant foundation for multi-agent applications.
