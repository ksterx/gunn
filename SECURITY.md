### Security Considerations in gunn

The gunn multi-agent simulation system handles potentially sensitive data and provides multi-tenant capabilities. Key security areas include:

#### Authentication and Authorization
- Agent identity verification
- Tenant isolation enforcement
- API access controls
- Rate limiting and quota enforcement

#### Data Protection
- PII redaction in logs and telemetry
- Secure storage of event logs
- Encrypted communication channels
- Memory protection for sensitive data

#### System Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-tenant data leakage prevention
- Secure configuration management

#### Network Security
- TLS/mTLS for external communications
- WebSocket security
- API endpoint protection
- Network isolation between tenants

### Security Best Practices for Users

When deploying gunn in production:

1. **Authentication**: Always enable authentication for external adapters
2. **Network Security**: Use TLS for all external communications
3. **Monitoring**: Enable security event logging and monitoring
4. **Updates**: Keep gunn and dependencies updated
5. **Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines
6. **Isolation**: Properly configure tenant isolation
7. **Logging**: Enable PII redaction in production logs

### Vulnerability Categories

We consider the following types of vulnerabilities:

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Cross-tenant data access
- Privilege escalation

#### High
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Data corruption
- Session hijacking

#### Medium
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Information leakage
- Weak cryptography

#### Low
- Security misconfigurations
- Weak password policies
- Information disclosure (limited)

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1 â†’ 0.1.2)
- Documented in release notes
- Announced through appropriate channels
- Backported to supported versions when possible

### Bug Bounty Program

We do not currently have a formal bug bounty program, but we appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge security researchers who help improve gunn's security.
